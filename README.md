OpenVR SDK
---

OpenVR is an API and runtime that allows access to VR hardware from multiple 
vendors without requiring that applications have specific knowledge of the 
hardware they are targeting. This repository is an SDK that contains the API 
and samples. The runtime is under SteamVR in Tools on Steam. 

### Documentation

Documentation for the API is available on the [Github Wiki](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/openvr/wiki/API-Documentation)

More information on OpenVR and SteamVR can be found on http://steamvr.com


### My Program
This is clone from the [OpenVR](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/openvr) project, and I have replaced the openGL hello world example with my own program, the disappearing pig! The main cpp file and all the shader code is found in ```samples/hellovr_openGL/```, and the program can be run through the VS solution, though the rest of the SDK and VR hardware is required.
